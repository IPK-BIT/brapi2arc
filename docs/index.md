# Welcome to BrAPI2ARC's documentation!
This API allows researchers to submit phenotyping observations to a dataset stored as an Annotated Research Context (ARC). The ARC provides a standardized structure for capturing and sharing research data, enabling reproducibility and transparency in scientific investigations.

## Getting Started
To begin using this API, please refer to our [Getting Started Guide](getting_started.md). This guide will walk you through the registration process, obtaining an API key, and providing a quick troubleshooting guide.

## API Overview
Our tool comes provides several BrAPI endpoints to interact with the ARC:

- `POST /search/germplasm`
- `POST /search/variables`
- `POST /observations`
- `GET /programs`
- `GET /trials`
- `GET /studies`
- `GET /studytypes`
- `GET /germplasm`
- `GET /observationunits`
- `GET /variables`

## Key Features
- Standardized data submission
- Version-controlled storage of research datasets
- Import of trial design
